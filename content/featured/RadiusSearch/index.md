A custom geospatial search tool for Hubble in Palantir Foundry, enabling users to efficiently find and filter objects within a radius on a map. The plugin integrates with Foundry's ontology system and supports geohash and coordinate string formats.

Built with Mapbox GL and React, it features intuitive UI components for specifying a search area, and dynamically returns results from large datasets based on proximity.
